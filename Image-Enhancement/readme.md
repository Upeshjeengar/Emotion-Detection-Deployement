# Image Enhancement using MIRNet

This project demonstrates the enhancement of images using the MIRNet architecture. MIRNet (Multi-Instance Realization Network) is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed to enhance the quality of images by improving their resolution, removing noise, and enhancing details.

## Introduction

Image enhancement is crucial for various applications, including photography, medical imaging, and satellite imagery. This project utilizes the MIRNet architecture to perform image enhancement, providing clear and detailed outputs from low-quality inputs.

## Features

- Enhances image resolution
- Reduces noise
- Preserves and improves details
- Easy-to-use interface for batch processing of images

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pillow
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Upeshjeengar/Emotion-Detection-Deployement/
cd Emotion-Detection-Deployement/Image-Enhancement
```

2. **Prepare your images:**

Place the images you want to enhance in a directory.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

Open the `image_enhancement.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to enhance your images.

4. **Display results:**

The notebook includes code to display the original and enhanced images side by side for comparison.

### Example

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image
import os

# Ensure that the number of images to display doesn't exceed the number of columns
sample_files = image_files[:min(num_images_to_enhance, 10)]  # Adjust number of images to display
num_columns = len(sample_files)  # Number of columns equals the number of images to display

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, num_columns, figsize=(20, 8))

for i, img_file in enumerate(sample_files):
    # Load original image
    original_img = Image.open(img_file)

    # Load enhanced image
    enhanced_img_mirnet_path = os.path.join(enhanced_images_path_mirnet, os.path.basename(img_file))
    enhanced_img_mirnet = Image.open(enhanced_img_mirnet_path)

    # Display original image
    axes[0, i].imshow(original_img)
    axes[0, i].axis('off')
    axes[0, i].set_title('Original')

    # Display enhanced image
    axes[1, i].imshow(enhanced_img_mirnet)
    axes[1, i].axis('off')
    axes[1, i].set_title('MIRNet Enhanced')

plt.suptitle(f'Comparison of Original and Enhanced Images (First {num_columns})', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

## Results

The enhanced images will be displayed alongside the original images in the Jupyter Notebook. You will see significant improvements in clarity, detail, and overall quality.
